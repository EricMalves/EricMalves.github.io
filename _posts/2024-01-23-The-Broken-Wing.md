Two years after the events of Anima: The Bird House, Lyall is living his new life. His new home in the outdoors is getting easier every day until an accident leaves him broken and in the hands of a wildlife rehabilitation clinic. Here, he is able to reflect on what he is and what he used to be, not knowing if he will ever return to his life in the wild.
